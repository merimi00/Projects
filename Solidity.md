### Lesson n°0: Welcome to Blockchain

bitcoin use blockchain released by Sukushi Matamoto, taking blockchain to mainstream

cryptography, digital store of value, bitcoin has a scare quantity,

Ethereum use the same blockchain technology with additional features

smart contracts are self executing sets of instructions without 3rd parties written in code problem oracle problem

block chains oracle bring real data to blockchain

Chainlinks bring data to blockchain/smart contracts and do external computation

hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain and off-chain components

Dapp == smart contract == decentralized app

1. Decentralized: node operators, run by a network
2. Transparency & Flexibility: play by the same rules, sudo anonymous
3. Speed & Efficiency: monitoring policy
4. Security & Immutability: several nodes go down doesn't matter, sustainable hard to 'hack',
5. Removal of counterparty risk: political, brand agreements to math agreements
6. Trust Minimized Agreements:
7. Hybrid smart contracts combine on and off-chain

DAOs: decentralized autonomous organisation

First Transaction in Ethereum: Metamask crypto wallet, Etherscan with the number of the account, Rinkeby make transaction is a faucet, gas fee a transaction cost money, das used * gas price = transaction fee,

Hash: unique fixed length string meant to identify a piece of data, created by hash function, Ethereum runs with Keccak 256, SHA356 hash, [andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hashandersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash](http://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hashandersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash),

Hash Algorithm: a function that computes data into a unique hash

mining: the process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem"; nodes get paid for mining blocks

Block: a list of transactions mined together

Decentralized: having no single point of authority

Nonce: a "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem

hash data and hash →

block nonce data and hash →

blockchain block, nonce, prev and hash →

distributed, multiple blockchain interacting peer to peer →

tokens block, nonce, tx [transaction table], prev [previous block] and hash →

[andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys](http://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys)

Public key: is derived from your private key. anyone can see it, and use it to verify that a transaction came from you

Signing a transaction: you can only do it

Private key ||||| → Public key → address

Public key created by private key and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm

we can verify the message with the public key but not guess the private key

that's how we sign the information but not how we send them

node: a single instance in a decentralized network peer A B

anyone can join the network

blockchains are resilient at least one nodes is still alive

blockchain nodes keep lists of the transactions that occur,

Consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain,

1. Chain selection [ Nakamoto consensus ]
2. Sybil resistance mechanism [ PoW proof of work || PoS proof of stake ]

Sybil attack: a single person sudo anonymous account to influence the blockchain with malicious information in their data

51% attack: longest chain rule and they do a fork add a node and try to influence the network

ETH Classic:

Scalability: price of gas rising as more people try transaction

Sharding solution to the scalability and very democratic

Rollups solution to the scalability

ETH and BTC are proof of work

ETH 2.0 proof of stake
